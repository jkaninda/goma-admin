// Package web embeds the built dashboard (the Vue SPA) into the Go binary so a
// single `goma` executable serves both the API and the UI — no static files to
// ship alongside it and no GOMA_WEB_DIR to configure.
//
// The `dist/` directory is a build artifact: `make build-ui` runs the Vue build
// and stages its output here, then `go build` bakes it in. Only a placeholder
// (.gitkeep) is committed, so `go build` and `go test` always compile on a clean
// checkout; in that case the embedded FS holds no index.html and the UI routes
// 404 while the API serves normally. Release and Docker builds always build the
// UI first, so shipped binaries are self-contained.

// Assets holds the built SPA under a top-level "dist/" directory. It is served
// through Okapi's WebFS with WebConfig{Root: "dist"}. The `all:` prefix keeps
// dotted files (the .gitkeep placeholder, and any dotfiles Vite emits), which
// //go:embed would otherwise skip.

//go:embed all:dist
